# ALISCUT

Minimal CLI show alias table

</div>

---

## Motivation

I usually define many aliases to avoid repeating long command-line instructions in the terminal. However, one day I opened the terminal and completely forgot what aliases I had created. I had to open the terminal configuration files and use cat just to check them, which became really annoying when I wanted to stay focused and work continuously. That frustration is exactly why this project exists.
